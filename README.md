### File Purposes:
- **`agents.md`**: Primary context file for AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop)
- **`docs/prd.md`**: Requirements and specifications for AI code generation
- **`docs/design.md`**: Technical design and architecture for implementation
- **`data/star.json`**: Structured team intelligence for agent context
- **`README.md`**: Human onboarding and project overview

## Design & Architecture

For the comprehensive technical design ready for implementation, see:

- [Design Document (`docs/design.md`)](docs/design.md)

## Implementation Plan

For a step-by-step execution plan aligned with the PRD and design, see:

- [Implementation Plan (`docs/implementation-plan.md`)](docs/implementation-plan.md)

This covers system architecture, components, data flow, APIs, database schema, auth, AI integration points, security controls, non-functional requirements, and deployment architecture.

## MCP Configuration

For Model Context Protocol agent/tool definitions used by Copilot and other agents, see:

- [MCP Config (`docs/mcp.json`)](docs/mcp.json)

### MCP Server (lightweight)

For a minimal MCP server and example tool registry, see:

- [MCP Server (`src/mcp-server/index.ts`)](src/mcp-server/index.ts)

### How to run the MCP server

Use the dedicated build and start scripts:

```bash
# Compile only the MCP server (uses src/mcp-server/tsconfig.json)
npm run build:mcp

# Run the compiled server
npm run start

# Or run directly in dev with ts-node
npm run start:mcp

# Live-reload dev mode
npm run dev:mcp
```

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js 20 (API routes)  
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)  
- **Authentication:** Clerk Auth

## AI Agents Architecture
- **Persona Agent:** Digital twin interactions, conversational AI, skill representation  
- **Security Guardian:** Threat detection, SQL/XSS detection, prompt injection prevention, blocking malicious inputs  
- **Content Creator:** Blog/project management, AI-powered markdown generation, MCP tool support  
- **Threat Analytics:** Security insights, pattern analysis, dashboard metrics, attack predictions  
- **Audit Logger:** Event logging, structured logs, real-time critical alerts  
- All agents work together securely, providing an interactive, self-defending portfolio experience.  

---

## Database Structure
- **security_events:** Logs all security events (severity, threat type, source IP, actions)  
- **blog_posts:** Stores blog content, slugs, tags, and authors  
- **projects:** Portfolio projects, tech stacks, GitHub/live URLs, README content  
- **threat_metrics_daily:** Materialized view for analytics dashboards  
- **Security:** Row-level security ensures only authorized users or system roles can access or insert data
