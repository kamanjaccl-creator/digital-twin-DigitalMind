      <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 16 }}>
        <strong>Hack us if you can.</strong> This portfolio is no longer just a showcase of
        work—it is a monitored, security-aware web system designed to run under real-world
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 16 }}>
        Modern professional web applications are active targets. Systems that manage data,
        users, and AI-driven features must be built to defend, monitor, and continuously
        improve their resilience. This project transforms our portfolio into a cyber-secured,
        intelligence-driven digital platform that demonstrates practical security
        implementation rather than theoretical claims.

      <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 24 }}>
        Developed as a collaborative initiative within an industry-aligned program delivered by
        <strong> ausbiz Consulting</strong>, this project focuses on building a production-ready
        web application capable of detecting threats, protecting data, and demonstrating
        defensive system design.

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, marginBottom: 8 }}>From Portfolio to Secure Digital System</h2>
        <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 8 }}>
          Our team designed and deployed a portfolio platform that integrates security
          controls, monitoring mechanisms, and layered defensive architecture to address common
          web application vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 8 }}>
          Security considerations include protection against:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li>SQL injection attacks</li>
          <li>Prompt injection and other malicious inputs</li>
          <li>Authentication and authorization weaknesses</li>
          <li>Broken access control</li>
          <li>Malicious payload execution (e.g., XSS)</li>
          <li>Automated bot activity and suspicious traffic behaviour</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginTop: 8 }}>
          Rather than treating security as a static feature, the system operates as a live
          cyber environment where behaviour is continuously monitored and improvements are
          regularly implemented.

        <h2 style={{ fontSize: 20, marginBottom: 8 }}>Evidence-Based Security Approach</h2>
        <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 8 }}>
          The project emphasises measurable and observable security practices. The platform is
          structured to support:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li>System activity logging and monitoring</li>
          <li>Threat detection and attacker behaviour analysis</li>
          <li>Risk awareness and defensive configuration tuning</li>
          <li>Documentation of system refinement and improvements over time</li>
          <li>Continuous system hardening through iterative development</li>
        </ul>
        <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginTop: 8 }}>
          This transforms the portfolio into a defensible case study of secure deployment and
          operational resilience.

          By completing this project, our team delivers a system that:
        </p>
        <ul style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, paddingLeft: 20 }}>
          <li>Hosts professional identity and project work in a security-focused environment</li>
          <li>Implements defensive controls within a real cloud deployment</li>
          <li>Demonstrates awareness of modern cybersecurity risks and attack patterns</li>
          <li>Applies security as an ongoing lifecycle practice, not a one-off task</li>
          <li>
            Reflects real-world development, observability, and deployment standards
          </li>

        <p style={{ color: "#9ca3af", fontSize: 14, marginBottom: 8 }}>
          This project is more than a portfolio—it is a deployable, auditable demonstration of
          secure web development practice. It reflects our ability to design systems that are
          not only functional and scalable, but also resilient and professionally defensible.
