# Product Requirement Document (Alias)

This file is an alias for the canonical PRD:

- See `docs/prd.md` for the full Product Requirements Document used by this project.

Keeping this alias ensures consistency with external references that expect `PR.md` while the repository stores the PRD as `docs/prd.md`.
